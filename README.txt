We utilized the n2p2-2.1.0 version for the training process and employed the LAMMPS-stable_3Mar2020 version for the NVT MD simulations using the atomic neural network force field. The version of Eigen, the C++ template library for linear algebra, that we used is 3.3.7. The test dataset is stored in the test_dataset.txt file, and the parameter settings of the atomic neural network are located in the input.nn file.
